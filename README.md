# Customer Service Chatbot

### Introduction
In this project, we will develop a conversational AI assistant (chatbot) to handle customer inquiries and provide support for a hypothetical e-commerce company. The chatbot will be capable of understanding natural language queries, retrieving relevant information, and generating appropriate responses.

### Prerequisites
Before starting this project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:
* Python 3.7 or higher
* PyTorch
* Transformers (Hugging Face library)
* RASA (Open-source conversational AI framework)
* spaCy (Natural Language Processing library)
* SQLite (or any other database engine)

### Step 1: Load the Dataset
First, we need to load the Stanford Conversational AI dataset, which contains conversations between customers and agents in various domains like banking, travel, and shopping.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_json('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gunthercox/chatterbot-corpus/master/data/stanford_convertional_ai/stanford_convertional_ai.json')
```
